# Really Common Visualisations

You’ll see some visualisation types everywhere. Here are some of the most common ones, created in Tableau Public.

All these examples are in Tableau Gallery here: [https://public.tableau.com/profile/sara.terp\#!/vizhome/DS\_session\_example/exampledashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sara.terp) and in Tableau Desktop here: [https://github.com/bodacea/inafu6513/blob/master/Notebooks/4.2 Tableau\_example.twb](https://github.com/bodacea/inafu6513/blob/master/Notebooks/4.2%20Tableau_example.twb)

## Multi-Line Graph

## Stacked Column Chart

Stacked column charts give you both totals \(the size of each line\) and relative contributions to each total \(the colours\).  Sometimes \(confusingly\) these are called stacked barcharts.

Barcharts are a 90-degree rotation of column charts.  These can be very useful if you have a lot of bars \(e.g. for the 300+ countries in the world\) and want the user to be able to scroll up and down the chart to see them all.

## Scatterplot

Scatterplots put a symbol at every combination of two \(2-dimensional scatterplot\) or three \(3-dimensional scatterplot\) values. These are useful for comparing pairs of features \(e.g. population size vs refugee numbers\) for a set of examples \(e.g. for each country\). 

Simple scatterplots put a dot at each x,y value; more complex scatterplots use different colours, symbols or symbol sizes to show values of other features of interest \(e.g. asylum seeker numbers, annual rainfall etc\).

## Dashboards

You can put visualisations and text together in a dashboard. You can also link these visualisations, so that when you click on a point in one visualisation, data relevant to that point is shown in another.

This is india’s government employee attendance dashboard. If you look at the bottom of Tableau, there’s a dashboard button.

## More Visualisation Types

Other visualisation types you’ll see a lot includeChord diagram, Sankey diagram, Choropleth, symbol map. The image above is from the D3 Gallery, https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery.

When you start, it’s hard to know what different visualisation types are called, which makes looking up how to create them much more difficult. The visualisation periodic table \([h](http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html)[ttp://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic\_table/periodic\_table.html](http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html)\) helps here: hover over each box to see an example of that type of plot
