# Communicating with Data

Normally at this point in the data science process, we’d start exploring the data, getting rough statistics and creating quick-and-dirty visualisations of it before using it, then communicating our results to an audience. But part of that process is thinking about the story we’d like to tell, and how to tell it, and a large part of that telling is often visual. Plus being able to create visualisations is always useful, even if you’re not doing data science.

So let’s start talking about how we communicate data, data-based results, and data-based insights.  We’re talking about communication, which is usually an exchange of information between entities. How we communicate is influence by what we believe is important, to both ourselves and our intended audience. And that needs to be designed.

## Engage your Audience

* Who are these people?
* * Demographics: which languages? What red flags?
  * What communications styles are they used to?
  * What channels are you using? Website, printed media, SMS?
* What have you got for them?
* * Insights? answers? surprises?
  * Exploring or explaining?
  * Do you want to engage, persuade, inform or entertain?
  * What do they already know?
* Why should they care?

Red flags are things you really need to be careful of.  For example: using orange and green for an Irish audience.

### Design Rules

* Storytelling:
* * Design for your medium \(e.g paper\)
  * Learn from the storytellers: have a beginning, middle and end
  * Use drill-down: summarise with visuals, but allow users to reach the data
  * Frame your message - why are you doing this, how did you get here

* Visualisations:
* * Have graphical integrity \(e.g. start bars at zero\)
  * Keep your charts simple: maximise the data:ink ratio
  * Use the right chart type for the data
  * No more than 5-8 colours per visualisation \(see colorbrewer2.org\)

See [http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/files/choosing\_a\_good\_chart.pdf](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/blog/files/choosing_a_good_chart.pdf) for advice on choosing the right chart type.. Sometimes it’s appropriate to throw data and graphs at the user, and let them work it out on their own, but usually drill-down and a story is the answer.  See Alberto Cairo’s work for more details.
