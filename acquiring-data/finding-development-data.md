# Finding Development Data

  
Your first problem is finding the data to help answer your questions.   Let's look at the types of data that are hiding online, and how to bring them out of hiding and into your data science code.

A quick recap: these are some of the places where you can find data. Some of them are harder to process than others, but they all contain data.

* Data files \(CSV, Excel, Json, Xml...\)
* Databases \(sqlite, mysql, oracle, postgresql...\)
* APIs
* Report tables \(tables on websites, in pdf reports...\)
* Text \(reports and other documents…\)
* Maps and GIS data \(openstreetmap, shapefiles, NASA earth images...\)
* Images \(satellite images, drone footage, pictures, videos…\)
* Social media \(twitter, facebook, instagram, youtube...\)
* People \(formal surveys, phone surveys, asking questions
* etc

And here are some places to find them \(NB there’s a longer list in the references at the end of this booklet\)

* data warehouses and catalogues
* open government data
* NGO websites
* web searches
* online documents, images, maps etc
* people you know who might have data

The last one there is very important.  A lot of development data is still hiding behind firewalls and on personal PCs: try to cultivate a network of people that you can ask about datasets. 

Development data isn’t always easy to obtain: you might have to create your own, by asking people to contribute information to you through crowdsourcing, in-person surveys, mobile surveys etc.  You might also need to generate data for your problem by using sensors.

## Be cynical about your data

Is the data relevant to your problem?

* Where did this data come from?
* * Who collected it?
  * Why? What for?
  * Do they have biases that might show up in the data?
* Are there holes in the data \(demographic, geographical, political etc\)?
* Do you have supporting data? Is it \*really\* from a different source?
* Can you use this data \(are there privacy or copyright issues with using it\)?

Selection bias = non-random selection of individuals. One example of this is pothole reporting: potholes are more generally reported in more-affluent areas, by people who have both the smartphone apps and the time and energy to report.

Missing data = data that you don’t have. You need to be aware of this, and take account of it. If you need more persuading, read about [Wald and the bullethole problem](http://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffreykabat/2013/01/17/making-room-for-the-unseen-in-tackling-complex-problems/).
