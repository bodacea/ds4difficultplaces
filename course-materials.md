# Course Materials

The materials for the original course are available at [https://github.com/bodacea/datascienceforbeginners](https://github.com/bodacea/datascienceforbeginners)

The slideset shared there is from the latest inception of the lab part of that course \(the non-lab half showed social data science in different contexts\): a set of sessions that started as a weekly one-hour chat between myself and the Quito ThoughtWorks team, and grew into a multi-city weekly data science session.

The way to approach these slides is to read the slide notes in each session's powerpoint file \(you'll probably have to download the files to see this: I'll slowly upload the notes if needed\), then try the exercises in the ipython notebooks for that session.

Thefirst sessionis an introduction, a 'why are we doing this', with a bunch of downloads and setups \(student- and developer- tested!\) as an exercise. I'll write about that soon. The downloads and setups are integral to these sessions \(to leave someone with enough tools, notes and information on their machines to be able to do basic data science, and understand what a data scientist does all day, even where there's no hope of stable Internet \(yet\)\), but though the learning is much better if you try the examples, the slides can be mostly followed without them.
