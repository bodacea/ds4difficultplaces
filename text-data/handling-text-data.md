# Handling Text Data

This session looks at a special type of data: text, as in the freeform sentences that people write or speak.  Text processing is a huge topic, so we’re just getting familiar with some of the key ideas. 

* Information retrieval
  * Search
  * Named entity recognition
* Learning
  * Classification
  * Clustering
  * Topic identification/ topic following
  * Sentiment analysis
  * Network analysis \(words, people etc\)
* Comprehension
  * Natural language processing
  * Translation
  * Truthfulness \(e.g. verifying phemes\)

Topic following: includes tracking things like hate speech \(iHub Nairobi has done a lot of work on this topic\). Verification: the [Pheme](http://www.pheme.eu/) project is working on automatically tracking the veracity of stories.
