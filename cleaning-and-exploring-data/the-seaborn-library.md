# The Seaborn Visualisation Library

Seaborn is a powerful python visualisation library designed for data science use.

`import seaborn as sns`

`iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')`

`sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species', size=2)`

Seaborn includes some example datasets, including the iris dataset that we met in the machine learning session.

NB You might want to do “`sns.set()`” before plotting, to change to the default Seaborn style.
