# Exploring with R

The most common data science coding languages are Python and R. We’re not going to teach R in these sessions, but you at least need to know how to run and use R files.

R does matrix analysis, similar to the way that the Pandas library does matrix analysis. It's good at rapid statistical analysis \(4000+ R libraries\) and rapidly-created static graphics. It's not so good at non-statistical things \(e.g. GIS data analysis\). 

## Running R code

Running R files:

* * From the terminal window: “R &lt;myscript.r —no-save”
  * From inside another R program: source\('myscript.r'\)

Writing your own R code:

* * iPython notebooks: create “R” notebook \(instead of python3\)
  * Terminal window: type “r”
     \(and “q\(\)” to quit\)
  * Rstudio: click on Rstudio tool

You can also run R from Python code, using the rpy2 library.
