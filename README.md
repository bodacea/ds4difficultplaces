# About this Booklet

This is the book of a weekly onsite/remote course on data science techniques, designed to get people who aren’t coders up to speed and trying some of those techniques out for themselves.

It's part of a set of courses whose tagline was the "anti-bullsh\*t courses": a place where students could learn what words like 'Drupal' and 'classifier' mean before they're trying to assess a technical proposal with those words in, and learn how to interact with data scientists and development teams, to learn their processes, language and needs, and ask the 'dumb questions' \(even though there are no dumb questions\) in a safe space.

Throw a rock on the internet and you'll hit a data science course. There are many of these, many covered by the open data science masters, and many places to learn the details of machine learning, R, business data science et al. What there isn't so much of on the internet is courses on how to specify a data science problem, how to interact with the people coming off those machine learning courses, or how to do data science work when you're days from the nearest stable internet connection. The latest course, Data Science for Development and Social Change, was designed for that. It changed a bit from its inception: we found ourselves heavily oversubscribed with students from not just International Development, but also Journalism, Medicine and other departments, and adjusted from a 12-person hands-on intensive lab format \(e.g. the coding course included D3 down to the CSS, HTML, SVG and Javascript level\) to a 30+ person lab lecture with ipython notebooks.

Course structure is one topic per week, with:

* Weekly reading list: blogposts, book chapters etc on that week’s topic, to be read before the session
* Weekly tool setups: tool needed to be installed on PCs before each session
* In session: Introduction to techniques on that topic
* In session: Lab time, trying Python/R code related to those techniques
* Post-session: “further reading” list of blogposts, books, courses etc, for anyone wanting to dive further into that topic

This gives an overview of 5-7 concepts per week, totalling up to a better understanding of how data scientists work, and hopefully also a desire to explore this topic further. Examples used will be taken from social data science and free/open-source tools; these should be supplemented by guest talks from company data scientists about their projects, work and toolsets. The sessions are based on a Spring 2016 Columbia University.
