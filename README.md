# About this Booklet

This was a weekly onsite/remote course, designed to get people who aren’t coders up to speed on data science techniques, and trying some of those techniques out for themselves.

Course structure is one topic per week, with:

* Weekly reading list: blogposts, book chapters etc on that week’s topic, to be read before the session
* Weekly tool setups: tool needed to be installed on PCs before each session
* In session: Introduction to techniques on that topic
* In session: Lab time, trying Python/R code related to those techniques
* Post-session: “further reading” list of blogposts, books, courses etc, for anyone wanting to dive further into that topic

This gives an overview of 5-7 concepts per week, totalling up to a better understanding of how data scientists work, and hopefully also a desire to explore this topic further. Examples used will be taken from social data science and free/open-source tools; these should be supplemented by guest talks from company data scientists about their projects, work and toolsets. The sessions are based on a Spring 2016 Columbia University.
