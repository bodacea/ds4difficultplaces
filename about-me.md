I've designed and taught 4 university courses in the past 3 years: ICT for development and social change \(DSC, with Eric from BlueRidge\), coding for DSC, data science coding for DSC and data science for DSC \(with Stefan from Sumall\). The overarching theme of each of them was better access and understanding of technical tools for people who work in areas where internet is unavailable or unreliable, and where proprietary tools are prohibitively expensive.

I teach data science literacy to different groups, and I've been struggling with a personal dilemma: I believe strongly in open access \(data, code, materials\), but each hour of lecture materials takes about 15-20 hours of my time to prepare: should I make everything openly available, or try to respect that preparation time?

Which is basically the dilemma that anyone open-sourcing goes through. And the answer is the same: release the materials. Made stronger by the realisation that I teach how to do field data science \(data science in places without internet connectivity\) and people in places without internet connectivity are unlikely to be dropping into New York for in-person sessions.
