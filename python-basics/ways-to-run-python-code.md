# Ways to run Python code

So you have some Python code - maybe written in these slides, maybe in a .py or .ipynb file. Let’s look at some of the ways you can run that code.

## Python in the terminal window



* ‘python’ runs the python interpreter. ‘ipython’ runs a version of the python interpeter that’s slightly friendlier to new users, e.g. it has better help.
* ‘python helloworld.py’ runs the python interpreter on a file called ‘helloworld.py’. If that file contains a set of python commands \(e.g. “print\(“Hello World!”\)”\), you’ll see the output of those commands. You can do the same thing with ipython, e.g. ‘ipython helloworld.py’. 

There’s a file called helloworld.py in your course notes. Try running it, then editing it \(any text editor will do, although some, like Sublimetext, are set up to point out any coding errors to you\), and running it again.

There are other ways to run Python code \(e.g. from another program\), but we won’t be doing that in this course.
