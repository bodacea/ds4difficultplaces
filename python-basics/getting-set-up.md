# Getting Set Up

The "tool install instructions" at the end of this booklet has detailed instructions on how to download and get set up in Python.  Do it. Come back when you're done.

Let's test that. Open your terminal window and type

`ipython`

`1 + 2.5`

`print('hello world!')`

`exit()`

That was your first python code. You opened up the ipython interpreter, then typed in ‘commands’ \(‘1+2’\) and got back outputs \(‘3’\). Then, because we’re tidy, you closed the python interpreter again.

We met several important things here. You met objects: “1” and “2.5” are numbers \(“1” is an integer number; “2.5” is a floating point number\); and “‘hello world!’” is a string.

You also met an operator: “+” and a function: print\(\).

* Operators do basic things to pairs of objects \(or sometimes to single objects\). For instance, “+” adds together the objects to the left and right of it. You’ll meet arthmetic operators \(+ add, - subtract, \* multiply, / divide\) and logical operators \(of which more soon\).
* Functions are pieces of pre-written code that \(usually\) do something that needs to be done often, like sending a friendly message.
