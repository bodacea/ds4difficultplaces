# More help with Python

We’ve just skimmed through the basics of Python - enough so you don’t get lost when I start showing example code. If you want to know more, there are lots of courses listed in the course reading list; IMHO the best of these is Jeff Knupp’s Learn Python the Hard Way \(available online for free at [http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/](#)\).  There are also lots of other suggestions in the “course reading list” section.

# Exercises

Your exercises were all built into the class. But if you want more…

### Jupyter Notebook

The iPython notebooks \(that you downloaded from github\) are there for you to learn more about the subjects in each class. Go play with them: take copies, edit the code and see what happens. In the terminal window:

* ‘cd’ to the directory containing the code example files \(.ipynb files\)
* Type “ipython notebook”
* Run each code cell in the example files

### \(optional\) Reading CSVs

**If you already know Python and iPython:**

Find a variety of CSV files; try reading each of them into python, and see if you get any errors or strange behaviours. Bonus points if you find CSV files containing accents or multiple languages.   And make a list of those strange behaviours so we can talk about them in the next class.
